when we want to initialize the git we need to run
the git init

as a local rep
the imp commands in the git as discussed in first day class 
git add >to  move the files from working area to staging
git add <filename> for specific file
git add . all the files in that dir
git commit -m "comment msg" it is used to move from staging to local repo
git commit -m "comment " <filename> specific file to commit
git commit -am "comment" we can use this on  the already commited files if we do any modification on the content
before going to commit we need to configure the below steps imp

=======================
we need to add the github (remote repo) to our local repo(know as master )the steps for that
first we need to verify the remote repo is showing or not in our local

git remote add <origin> <remote repor url >
in the place of origin we can keep alias as anything i given name as
git remote add Swiss <remote repo https or ssh>

perfom the push to send the code from local to remote

git push Swiss master
